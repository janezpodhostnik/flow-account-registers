# Flow Account Registers

This uses The archive node, and a locally executed script + transaction with storage iteration,
to (hopefully) iterate and over all the accounts registers, and force them to be loaded.
Those registers are then recorded and dumped.

Deployed to [frd.eloquence.is](https://frd.eloquence.is/0xf919ee77447b7497)

:warning: DISCLAIMER:

- This is very dirty and hackish code, and is more of a demonstration then a legitimate tool
- The deployment might break at any time, and I might not have time to fix it often
